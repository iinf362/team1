<p>&nbsp; In most cities and towns in New York State, a landlord can charge anything he or she wants to rent an apartment to you. There are some places in New York State that place limits, by law, on what a landlord can charge in certain buildings in those locations. Those restrictions can also impose a duty on the landlord to renew your lease when the term ends. This section helps describe some of those restrictions and where in New York State they can apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Rent control and rent stabilization are the two types of rent regulation in New York State. If an apartment is not covered by one of these regulations, it is considered "unregulated." Some apartments may fall under more than one category.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This Question-and-Answer Dialogue will help you understand the laws that govern the amount of rent a landlord can charge.</p>

        <h2 class="custom-title">Are there limits on what a landlord can charge in rent?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp; The first limit on what a landlord can charge in rent is the amount for rent that is stated in the lease agreement between the tenant and the landlord. You should not have to pay more than the lease amount. When the term of the lease ends, in most cities and towns in New York State, the landlord can seek to increase the rent if you want to renew the lease, and you can only renew the lease with the landlord’s consent. There are places in New York State where there are limits on the amount of rent a landlord can charge in certain buildings in those cities and towns. Keep reading for more details on where these restrictions apply.</p>

    <div class="cont-custom">
        <p>&nbsp; Rent control limits the rent an owner can charge for an apartment and restricts the right of the owner to evict tenants. The rent control program applies to apartment buildings built before February, 1947, in municipalities that have not declared an end to the postwar rental housing emergency. Several municipalities in New York State still have rent control, including New York City, Albany, Erie, Nassau and Westchester counties.</p>

       <h2 class="custom-title">What is rent stabilization?</h2>
       <p>&nbsp; Generally, in New York City, apartments are under rent stabilization if they are in buildings of six or more units built between February 1, 1947 and December 31, 1973. Tenants in buildings built before February 1, 1947, who moved in after June 30, 1971, are also covered by rent stabilization. A third category of rent stabilized apartments covers buildings with three or more apartments constructed or extensively renovated on or after January 1, 1974 with special tax benefits. Outside New York City, rent stabilized apartments are generally found in buildings with six or more apartments that were built before January 1, 1974, in localities that have adopted the law. Such localities can be found mostly in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland counties.</p>

       <h2 class="custom-title">Where are there limits on what a landlord can charge?</h2>
       <p>&nbsp; Local Rent Guidelines Boards in New York City, Nassau, Rockland and Westchester counties set maximum rates for rent increases once a year which are effective for one or two year leases beginning on or after October 1st each year. Tenants in rent stabilized apartments are entitled to receive required essential services and to have their leases renewed, and may not be evicted except on grounds allowed by law.</p>
       <p>&nbsp; In New York City, each rent controlled apartment has a maximum base rent that is adjusted every two years to reflect changes in operating costs. Tenants can challenge increases if:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>the rent being charged by the landlord is more than the legal regulated rent,</li>
        <li>the building has housing code violations,</li>
        <li>the owner’s expenses do not justify an increase, or</li>
        <li>the owner is not maintaining essential services.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="custom-bar"><div class="menu custom-menu"> Rent Security Deposits </div></div>
    <div class="cont-custom">
       <p>&nbsp; Most landlords will require tenants to give a security deposit to rent out an apartment. The security deposit is usually the equivalent of one month's rent. If a lease is renewed at a greater amount or the rent is increased during the term of the lease, the owner is permitted to collect additional money from the tenant in order to bring the security deposit up to the new monthly rent. A landlord may use the security deposit as a reimbursement for the reasonable cost of repairs beyond normal wear and tear on the apartment, if the tenant damages the apartment, or a reimbursement for any unpaid rent.</p>
       <p>&nbsp; The landlord must return the security deposit, less any lawful deduction, to the tenant at the end of the lease or within a reasonable time thereafter. (See "Ending the Landlord-Tenant Relationship.") The landlord is obligated to return the security deposit whether or not the tenant asks for its return. To avoid any disputes, the tenant should thoroughly inspect the apartment with the landlord before moving in and document any pre-existing conditions that need repair. Upon vacating, the tenant should leave the apartment in clean condition, removing all personal belongings and trash from the apartment.</p>
       <p>&nbsp; Landlords, regardless of the number of units in the building, must hold the money given as a security deposit for the tenant. The landlord may not mix these deposits with their own money. Landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must put all security deposits in New York bank accounts earning interest at the prevailing rate. Each tenant must be informed in writing of the bank's name and address and the amount of the deposit.</p>
       <p>&nbsp; Landlords are entitled to collect annual administrative expenses of one percent of the deposit. All other interest earned on the deposits belongs to the tenants. Tenants must be given the option of having this interest paid to them annually, applied to rent, or paid at the end of the lease term. If the building has fewer than six apartments, a landlord who voluntarily places the security deposits in an interest bearing bank account must also follow these rules. For more on security deposits see "Ending the Landlord-Tenant Relationship."</p>
       <p>&nbsp; It is illegal for any person to require a prospective tenant to pay a bonus- commonly called "key money"- above the lawful rent and security deposit, for preference in renting a vacant apartment. Key money is not to be confused with fees that may be legally charged by a licensed real estate broker. Penal Law § 180.55.</p>
